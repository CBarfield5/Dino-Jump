# Dino-Jump
This is a recreation of the Google Chrome browser Dino Jump game. NOTE: I do not own the rights to the images used in this game. This game is made just for fun and experience. NOTE: Gamebox.py code is the original work of Luther Tychonievich, who released it into the public domain. Gamebox.py is needed to run the program.

This game was designed in Pycharm Community Edition with the Pygame class add on. All files attached must be placed in the same directory when trying to run the game.

dinojump.py is my original work and is the file that contains all of the game operational code. You must run this code to start the game

Enjoy!
